## RANSAC Implementation in C++

This is a simple implementation of the RANSAC (Random Sampling Consensus) algorithm in C++. **RANSAC** is a robust method used for fitting models to data containing a significant number of outliers.

To test this algorithm, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**

2.  **Navigate to the Build Directory**
    ```bash
    cd build
    ```

3.  **Run the RANSAC Executables**

    * For **RANSAC Line** (fitting the equation of a line):
        ```bash
        ./RL
        ```

    * For **RANSAC Plane** (fitting the equation of a plane):
        ```bash
        ./RP
        ```
